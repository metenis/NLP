# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines **computational linguistics** with **machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

## Applications of NLP

- **Text Analysis**: Sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and keyword extraction.  
- **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another (e.g., Google Translate).  
- **Speech Recognition**: Converting spoken language into text (e.g., Siri, Alexa).  
- **Chatbots & Virtual Assistants**: Automating conversations with users.  
- **Text Generation**: Creating human-like text (e.g., GPT models).  
- **Information Retrieval**: Searching and retrieving relevant information from large datasets.

## Key Concepts in NLP

### Text Preprocessing
- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into individual words or phrases (tokens).  
- **Stemming & Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base or root form.  
- **Lowercasing**: Converting all text to lowercase for consistency.  
- **Stop Words Removal**: Removing common words (e.g., *the, is, and*) that do not add significant meaning.  

### Advanced NLP Techniques
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS)**: Identifying the grammatical parts of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).  
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Detecting and classifying entities like names, dates, and locations.  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the emotional tone of text (positive, negative, neutral).  
- **Language Modeling**: Predicting the next word in a sequence (e.g., GPT, BERT).  
- **N-grams**: Extracting sequences of *n* consecutive words to understand patterns (e.g., bigrams, trigrams).  
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**:  
  - Finding specific word patterns in text (e.g., emails, phone numbers, URLs).  
  - Removing unwanted characters like punctuation, special symbols, or numbers.  
  - Extracting structured information from unstructured text.  
  - Validating user input (e.g., checking if an input is a valid email address).

## Example Use Cases

This repository demonstrates how to use NLP techniques to analyze and process text data. Some example use cases include:

- Preprocessing text data (cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal, regex-based filtering).  
- Performing **sentiment analysis** on a dataset.  
- Extracting **n-grams** from a text corpus.  
- Using **regex** to extract email addresses or clean noisy text.  
- Building a **simple chatbot** using NLP libraries like **NLTK, SpaCy,** or **Hugging Face Transformers**.

## Installation

To get started with this project, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install nltk spacy transformers scikit-learn regex

For NLTK, you may need to download some datasets:

import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('omw-1.4')

Example: Removing Stop Words & Using Regex

Hereâ€™s an example of removing stop words and cleaning text with regex:

import re
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Download stopwords if not already downloaded
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')

# Sample text
text = "Hello World! This is an EXAMPLE of Text Processing, using NLP. Email me at example@email.com."

# Convert text to lowercase
text = text.lower()

# Remove punctuation and special characters using regex
text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', text)

# Tokenize text
tokens = word_tokenize(text)

# Remove stop words
filtered_words = [word for word in tokens if word not in stopwords.words('english')]

# Print the cleaned text
print(" ".join(filtered_words))

Output:

hello world example text processing using nlp
